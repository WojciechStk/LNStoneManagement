Why was this program created?

I wrote this little program with my fianc√©e in mind.
As a hobby, she creates various types of jewelry for friends using semi-precious stones for this purpose, such as: semi-precious and precious stones, surgical steel, threads, strings, cabochons ... say that the manufacturer is limited only by his imagination. And maybe a pocket sometimes.

Some of her works can be viewed in the "Gallery" tab or through the "Instagram" tab.

What is this program for?

The general assumption is that this program will allow:
- creating a database of purchased items,
- calculating the cost of purchasing materials needed to make, for example, a bracelet,
- calculating a margin on sales (it is known that family and friends are always on a low threshold),
- shopping in one of your favorite stores,
- social media management.

I want to add in the near future:
- the ability to add photos to the gallery,
- photo captions informing what elements were used to make a given jewelery.

Afterword.

If you have a similar hobby / job and have any suggestions on what could be added to the program or found a bug, please contact: "AdalbertS@protonmail.com"
